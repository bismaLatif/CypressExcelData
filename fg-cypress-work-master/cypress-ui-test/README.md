# OrangeHRM

Automated the OrangeHRM Admin model using the Cypress

In this Project I have automated the Admin model of Orange HRM website "https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/index.php/Admin"

In this project there are few interesting thing that are automated like:

- multiple selection of Items from list
- Conversion of hec color code to rgb and then compare
- data driven using the Json File
- File uploading using the .attachfile  method
and many more.



**Note:** After cloning the code, so execute the following commands to start the project:

1. npm install cypress --save-dev   
#(if cypress is not installed in the Laptop, else skip 1st step)
2. npm install
3. npx cypress open

_Thanks._
